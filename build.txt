Build the API
Build a Key-Value REST API using FastAPI and persist data using Django ORM with PostgreSQL/MySQL.

APIs

POST /items/ → create {key, value}

GET /items/{key} → get value by key

PUT /items/{key} → update value by key

DELETE /items/{key} → delete by key

GET /items/ → list items (support pagination with page, page_size)

Rate Limit
Apply rate limiting for /items/*: 60 requests/min per client, return HTTP 429 when exceeded.

Build a Python Client (production-grade)
Build a Python client to interact with the above API with reliability and fault tolerance.

Requirements

Fault Tolerance & Retries

Handle transient failures and network-level errors

Correctly handle HTTP 429 responses

Backoff Strategy

Implement Exponential Backoff for retries

Add Jitter to retry delays

Idempotency & Safety

Ensure data integrity when retrying non-idempotent operations

Prevent duplicate record creation / inconsistent states during retries

Please share the code as a zip folder (or a repo link) and include a short README with steps to run locally.
